# Product Quality Determination in Dark Chocolate Bars
For this project, I used data from the database 'Chocolate Bar Ratings' on website 'Flavors of Cocoa' to determine if there was a correlation to characteristics of a dark chocolate bar to quality. This project includes performing cleaning operations on scrapped website data, conducting statistical tests ANOVA and Pearson's R, and an exploratory data analysis. I used Tableau to create my data story (https://tabsoft.co/2RuVE8H).
